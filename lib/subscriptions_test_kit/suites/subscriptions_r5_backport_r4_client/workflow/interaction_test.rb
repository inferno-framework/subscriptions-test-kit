      description %(
        During this test, the client under test will interact with Inferno following the Subscription
        workflow over a `rest-hook` channel. This includes the following steps
        1. The client under test sends a Subscription request to Inferno
        2. Inferno sends a handshake notification request to the endpoint specified in the Subscription.
        3. Inferno sends an event notification request to the endpoint specified in the Subscription.

        While these steps are taking place and after, Inferno will be waiting for the user to indicate that
        the interaction has completed successfully or failed for some reason. Additionally, the client
        system may make additional requests, such as `$status` checks, while the test is waiting.
        Afterwards, Inferno will no longer respond to requests.

        To create the handshake and event notifications, Inferno uses the contents of the *Event
        Notification Bundle* input. The provided notification will be modified as appropriate for 
        the request Inferno is making:
        - General changes for all notification types
          - update the `subscription` parameter entry reference.
          - update the `status` parameter entry based on the previous interactions.
          - update the `type` parameter entry based on the notification type (e.g., `event-notification` or `handshake`).
          - update the number of notifications sent in the `events-since-subscription-start` parameter entry.
        - `handshake`-specific changes:
          - clear the `events` parameter entry.
          - clear the `errors` parameter entry.

        While the provided Notification must be conformant to the 
        [R4 Topic-Based Subscription Notification Bundle 
        profile](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport/STU1.1/StructureDefinition-backport-subscription-notification-r4.html)
        for the tests to pass, the tests can run as long as the notification meets the
        following minimal requirements:
        1. The provided content must be a valid json representation of a FHIR Bundle resource.
        2. The first instance in the Bundle is a Parameters resource.
        3. The first Parameters instance has a `subscription` parameter entry.

            Inferno will wait until the the event notification workflow is complete. The steps in the workflow are:

            1. Inferno expects a Subscription POST request at:

              `#{fhir_subscription_url}`

              with the Authorization header set to:

              `Bearer #{access_token}`

            2. Inferno will send a handshake notification to the rest-hook endpoint specified in the subscription.

            3. After a 5â€“10 second delay, Inferno will send an event notification to the rest-hook endpoint.

            At any point while this test is waiting, Inferno will respond to Subscription GET and $status requests.

            If at any point something has gone wrong and the client is unable to continue,

            attempts to send requests or to complete or fail the tests using the links above
            will result in a *"session not found"* error.
